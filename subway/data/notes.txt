Dataset Containing NTA Data (The one which WORKS) - https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/2010-Neighborhood-Tabulation-Areas-NTAs-/cpf4-rkhq

Dataset Containing CDTA Mapping (The one with SCALING ISSUES but MIGHT come handy in mapping NTA-TO-CDTA) - https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/census-download-metadata.page


NOTEBOOKS:
1) Bus Data Exploration.ipynb - We realize that there is a problem with the dataset . just keeping it in case I need for future analysis. Mapping CDTA to NTA etc.

2) Bus Data New.ipynb - For each borough, we find NTA to Day Mapping -> *takes hours to run* but we can manage with the 5 datasets. - 3 months of data.

3) EDA.ipynb - Contains visualizations... daywise bus frequency for each NTA and weekday vs weekday frequency for each NTA 


FOR SUBWAY:
copy most of the code from Bus Data New.ipynb
only remove this line of code => if nta['boroname'][ntaIDX] == 'Staten Island': and change indentation.
