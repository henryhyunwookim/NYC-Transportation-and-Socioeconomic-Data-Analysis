<b>Description</b><br>
This project aims to analyze access to transport infrastructure in the city of New York and assess whether the transport systems are accessible to all types of populations, especially those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and other vulnerable populations.<br>
<br>
<b>Data Sources and Analyses</b><br>
The project primarily consists of three sets of analyses as follows:<br>
<ul>
1) Analyses on taxi trip data, sourced from the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page">NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC)</a><br>
2) Analyses on subway ride data, sourced from the <a href="https://transitfeeds.com/p/mta">NYC Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)</a><br>
3) Analyses on socioeconomic data, sourced from the <a href="https://furmancenter.org/">NYU Furman Center</a><br>
</ul>
Each set of analyses and how to load, clean, and process datasets can be found in the Jupyter Notebooks (i.e. .ipynb files) in the respective folder (i.e. "taxi", "subway", and "socio").<br>
Also, raw and processed data files are stored in the "data" folder under the respective folder so that the processes and analyses in the notebooks can be replicated.<br>
<br>
<b>Installation</b><br>
To run the notebooks, please install the required packages by running the following command:<br>
pip install -r requirements.txt
